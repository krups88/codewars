/*1. Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

function evenOrOdd(number) {
    return number % 2 ? "Odd" : "Even"
}
evenOrOdd(5)
console.log(evenOrOdd(5))*/

/*2.Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.
const min = (list) => Math.min (...list)
    
const max = (list) => Math.max (...list)

console.log(min([12 , 20 ,50 , -50 , 25 ,111]))
console.log(max([12 , 20 ,50 , -50 , 25 ,111]))*/
